**Source Code of My HomeSite**

This is the source code of my [Home Page](http://adnansiddiqi.com). I'm releasing it with hope that it could be useful for those developers who struggle to come up with their own profile page. The content of the site is controlled by a YAML file so there's no need to get into HTML file for sake of changing content.

The source is released under **MIT Licenses**.

### TODO
* Currently it does not support any version of IE. I am redirecting it to [noie](http://adnansiddiqi.com/noie.html).
* META tags and page title is not YAML controlled.

That's it for now. More information about this project will be updated soon.

Enjoy!
